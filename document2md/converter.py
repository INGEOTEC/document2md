    mineru auto-detects which parts of the document need OCR internally, so

    much cleaner Markdown (real paragraphs, accurate headings) than plain
    text-layer extraction — at the cost of being far slower (mineru runs
    real layout/OCR models even on already-digital text).

    Complex tables, which mineru emits as raw HTML, are rewritten to Markdown
    tables (see tables.html_tables_to_markdown) so the output is Markdown all
    the way through.

    If MINERU_API_URL is set (see mineru_server.MineruServer), reuses that
    already-running server instead of letting mineru spin up (and tear down)
    its own temporary one for this single call — this is what lets a batch
    of documents avoid reloading the models once per document.

    `keep_mineru_output` writes mineru's raw output (its own Markdown, layout
    JSON, rendered layout/model PDFs...) to `<md stem>_mineru/` next to
    `md_path` instead of a temp dir that disappears at the end of the call —
    useful when a conversion looks wrong and mineru's own read of the page is
    the first thing worth inspecting.

    This is the OCR path for notes that come as scanned pages rather than
    digital text — e.g. the JPEGs downloaded by dofjson's
    download_nota_imagenes(). Each image is OCR'd with the same mineru
    pipeline backend as convert_to_markdown() and the results are
    concatenated in the order given (page order), so a note spanning several
    pages becomes one continuous Markdown file.

    Complex tables mineru emits as raw HTML are rewritten to Markdown tables
    (see tables.html_tables_to_markdown), like convert_to_markdown().

    The page images typically hold more than the note of interest (a page can
    start or end mid-note); callers wanting only one note should slice the
    result afterwards — see cutter.cut_markdown_by_titles(), or use
    BatchConverter, which does the cut inline.

    Figures mineru extracts from a page are copied next to the output under
    `<md stem>_images/<image stem>/` (namespaced per page so figures from
    different pages can't collide), and their Markdown references rewritten to
    match. Raises subprocess.TimeoutExpired like convert_to_markdown().

    `keep_mineru_output`, like in convert_to_markdown(), keeps mineru's raw
    per-page output instead of discarding it — each page lands in its own
    `<md stem>_mineru/<image stem>/` subdirectory, mirroring how the
    extracted figures are namespaced per page.

    A note spanning several pages OCRs each page with a separate `mineru`
    invocation; left alone, that means reloading mineru's layout/OCR models
    once per page. When MINERU_API_URL isn't already set (i.e. no caller is
    already running a batch server across multiple notes) and there's more
    than one page, this starts a MineruServer for the duration of the loop
    so all of this note's pages share one already-warm server instead of
    each page starting and stopping its own."""
