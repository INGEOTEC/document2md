"""Batch document-to-Markdown conversion, keeping one mineru-api server warm

from — a job is just a PDF (a single path) or a set of scanned page images (a
list of paths), an output directory, and an output filename. Whatever calls
this decides what those mean (a DOF legal provision, or anything else).
