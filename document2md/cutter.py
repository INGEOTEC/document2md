"""Slice the Markdown OCR'd from a note's scanned page images down to just the
note of interest.

The page images downloaded for a note (dofjson.download_nota_imagenes) hold
whole pages: the first page usually begins with the tail of the previous note,
and the last page often ends with the start of the next one. But the per-day
note index gives us the title of every note in order, so we can locate two
boundaries in the OCR'd text — where THIS note's title appears (start) and
where the NEXT note's title appears (end) — and keep only what lies between.

Matching is fuzzy on purpose: OCR text differs from the index title in case,
accents, line breaks and the odd misread character, so titles are compared on
an accent-folded, marker-stripped, whitespace-collapsed form, and located with
difflib's longest-matching-block alignment rather than an exact search.

    `from_norm` lets the caller skip past an earlier region — used to find the

    titles are near-duplicates (e.g. two deslinde avisos differing only in a
    number) and a whole-text search would otherwise anchor on the first.

    Confidence is matched characters divided by the span of haystack they are
    spread across (floored at the title's own length): a title that appears
    together, even split by a few OCR glitches, matches within a span close
    to its own length. Boilerplate that merely echoes some of the title's
    words (e.g. a shared date phrase in running prose) racks up the same
    matched-character count but scattered over a much wider span, so it is
