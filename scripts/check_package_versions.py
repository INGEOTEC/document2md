"""Check every publishable package's local version against PyPI.

`publish-pypi.yml` only checks, at the moment a tag is pushed, that the tag
matches `pyproject.toml`. Nothing checks *before* that whether the local
version is actually ahead of what PyPI has, or whether it jumped more than
one release past it — so `__version__` can drift arbitrarily far from what
is actually published (issue #194).

For each package, this reports PyPI's latest version, the local version
(read from `pyproject.toml`'s dynamic `<pkg>.__version__` attribute without
importing the package, so it needs none of its dependencies installed), and
whether the local version is a valid single-step jump ahead of PyPI: the
next patch, or the next minor with patch reset to 0. A package PyPI has
never published (`pypi_latest_version` returns `None`) always passes this
check — there is nothing to jump ahead of yet. So does a package marked
`[tool.document2md] tombstone = true`: a renamed package's final release,
whose version stops moving once it is published (see `is_tombstone`).

This repository publishes two packages rather than a directory of them:
`document2md` itself, which is the repository root, and the `dof2md`
tombstone under `dof2md/` — so the directory of each is looked up in
`PACKAGE_DIRS` instead of being derived from a common parent.

Usage:

    python scripts/check_package_versions.py
    python scripts/check_package_versions.py --package document2md
